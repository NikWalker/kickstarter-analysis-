*Based on the launch date outcomes, it is reccomended to have preperations for the kickstarter done in April as we start to see a rise in successful outcomes. May, however will be the best month to start the kickstarter. Note that we see a steady decrease of successfull outcomes as the summer months continue, whereas winter has the least amount of successful outcomes. 
*Failed outcomes are generally consistant throughout the year, indicating failure due to other variables within the Kickstarter.

*Here we take a look at the outcomes of play kickstarters within the scope of theater. This data shows that there are more successful play kickstarters than failed.

##Kickstarter Funding Recommendation 
---
The average goal of the successful US kickstarters was $5,049, whereas the average goal of failed kickstarters was $10,554. The median goal for those failed goals, was a goal of $5000. This means the data is skewed left, meaning that as the kickstarters rise in goal past $5000, the more unsuccessful they may become. It is reccomended that Louise tries to lower their kickstarter goal of $10,000. A Kickstarter around $5000 would have a better chance at successfully raising money for their play.
